# RMSD Considering Testlet Effects 

This repository contains the code for data simulation and analysis for the paper "RMSD Considering Testlet Effects."

The R files contain the code for the simulation and are ordered according to the way in which they should be used. 
The data that helped inform the simulation are available online [https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-database/index.html]. 
The slurm file contains the code to run this simulation on Big Red 200 (a high-performing computer available at IUB, for more information, see https://kb.iu.edu/d/brcc).

If you have questions or require more information, don't hesitate to get in touch with the corresponding author, Montserrat Valdivia Medinaceli, at mbvaldiv@iu.edu.
